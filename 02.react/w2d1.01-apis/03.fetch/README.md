# The Fetch API

JavaScript offers a built-in method to consume APIs. It is an API itself. It's called the Fetch API.

The global `fetch()` method returns a Promise. We can chain `.then`, `.catch`, and/or `.finally` onto a `fetch()` call as necessary.

A typical Fetch call looks like this:

```js
fetch('http://example.com/api/things')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => console.log(res.results))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

Let's take a look at what's happening here.

First, we make a Fetch request to some non-existent api to fetch an array of  "thing" objects.

Fetch returns a "thenable" Promise, so we can chain a `.then` call onto the back of it. You'll usually see these calls on separate lines like this. JavaScript doesn't care about white space.

In our first `.then` call, we have an arrow function. We name the parameter `res`, which is short for response, then return the result of calling the `.json()` method on it.

This method takes a response stream and parses it from raw JSON into a JavaScript object. It also returns a Promise, so we can chain another `.then` call onto it.

In the second `.then` call, we have another arrow function. We name this parameter `res` as well, but it is the JavaScript object version returned by the `.json()` call. We then then simply log `res.results` to the console, but we can do anything we like here, like setting some piece of state in a React app.

Finally, we catch any errors in a call to `.catch` and log the error object (which we call `err`) to the console.

## What is `res.results`?

When we make a Fetch call, we need to know what the response object looks like. It could look like anythingâ€”these are JSON responses. Before we use the response, we should at least log it, or even better, see what the response looks like in our browser (with [JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US)) or in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

This example assumes that the "things" requested in the URL are in an array whose key is `results`. This is typical for list requests.
