# APIs

Strictly speaking, an API is a mechanism comprised of a set of definitions and protocols that enables two software components to communicate with each other. There are APIs in libraries and frameworks, APIs for operating systems, web APIs, etc.

So when we talk about APIs, we need to know what type we're talking about.

The terms REST API, RESTful API, or Web API are all referring to the same thing. An API that conforms to a specific software architectural style. It describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, usually across the internet in a client-server architecture.

In our line of work as web developers, if someone says "API" without specifying the type of API they're referring to, they're probably talking about Web APIs, like the ones in [this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

Later this week, we'll be building our own back-end RESTful APIs. Today, we're learning how to consume a Web API. First with Fetch, then with Axios.
