# Intro to ES6

## What is ES6?
ES6 is short for ECMAScript 6. Great! What's ECMA? ECMA used to be an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association. They changed their name to "Ecma" to reflect the organization's global reach.

They are a nonprofit standards organization that exists to ensure interoperability of client-side scripting languages across different browsers.

JavaScript is one of the languages that adheres to the standards set forth by Ecma. ES6 refers to the 6th edition of these standards, released in 2015.

There are more recent editions of ECMAScript. ES6 is not the newest edition, but it was a major revision that brought a host of new features to JavaScript.

This is why developers differentiate between pre-ES6 and post-ES6 JavaScript. Think of ES6 like Jimi Hendrixâ€”it changed the way we write JavaScript just like Hendrix changed the way musicians played guitar.
