# Arrow Functions

Up to now, you've been creating functions using the function declaration syntax. It should be very familiar to you by now:

```js
function add1(num) {
    return num + 1;
}
```

In JavaScript, functions are "first class citizens," they can do what everything else can do. This means that functions can be assigned to variables, they can be passed as arguments to other functions, they can be returned from a function, etc.

With that in mind, let's rewrite the above function declaration into a *function expression*. We will assign an anonymous function as the value of a variable named `add1`.

```js
const add1 = function(num) {
    return num + 1;
}
```

This code a bit more robust than the function declaration example. We are declaring a variable using the `const` keyword, which prevents reassignment of the variable and also limits any unwanted side effects of hoisting.

Let's use ES6 arrow function syntax to further simplify this code.

*Note: Each step along the way is a valid "arrow function".*

1. First, we will remove the `function` keyword entirely and place an arrow between the parameter and opening curly brace.


    ```js
    const add1 = (num) => {
        return num + 1;
    }
    ```

2. Next, we will remove the curly braces and the `return` keyword. This is called an implicit return.
   
    ```js
    const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
    ```

3. Finally, we will remove the parentheses around the parameter.
   
    ```js
    const add1 = num => num + 1;
    ```
An arrow function expression is another example of ES6 "syntactic sugar". It provides an alternative to the traditional function expression.

Some rules to keep in mind:

- If the body of your arrow function is more than one line, curly braces and the `return` keyword are required.
  
    ```js
    const add1 = num => {
        num += 1;
        return num;
    }
    ```
- If you have one parameter, the parentheses surrounding it are optional.
   
    ```js
    const add1 = num => num + 1;
    // or
    const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
    ```
- If you have zero parameters or more than one parameter, the parentheses surrounding them are required.
   
    ```js
    const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
    // or
    const theAnswer = () => 42;
    ```
One thing to watch out for, though—avoid using arrow functions as methods. The `this` keyword may behave in ways in which you don't expect.

```js
const dekku = {
  realName: "Izuku Midoriya",
  display: () => console.log(this.realName)
};

dekku.display();
// undefined
```

Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this`.
