# Postman

Postman is a very useful app. It makes it very easy to test each of our API endpoints. We can send get requests, form data or JSON post requests, put requests, and delete requests.

As we build our API, let's remember to "code a little and test a lot". Get one endpoint working at a time.

To get to know Postman, I suggest using [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It's a free fake API for testing and prototyping.
